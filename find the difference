You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

##CODE
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char,int>mpp;
        char chara;
        for(auto it:s){
            mpp[it]++;
        }

       for(auto it:t){
        if(mpp.count(it)){
            if(mpp[it]==0){
               chara=it;
            }
        }
        else{
            chara=it;
        }
        mpp[it]--;
       }
        return chara;
    }
};
